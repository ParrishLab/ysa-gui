Welcome to meaGUI's documentation!
==================================

**meaGUI** is a Python application designed for the efficient analysis of multi-electrode array (MEA) data. 
At its core, meaGUI features a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to visualize and analyze MEA data in a user-friendly manner. 
The GUI is built using the `PyQt5 <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/>`_ and `pyqtgraph <http://www.pyqtgraph.org/>`_ libraries.
