Welcome to meaGUI's documentation!
===================================

**meaGUI** is a Python application designed to facilitate the analysis of
multi-electrode array (MEA) data. At it's core, meaGUI is a graphical user
interface (GUI) that allows users to visualize and analyze MEA data in an
efficient and user-friendly manner. The GUI is built on top of the `PyQt5 <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/>`_
and `pyqtgraph <http://www.pyqtgraph.org/>`_ libraries.
