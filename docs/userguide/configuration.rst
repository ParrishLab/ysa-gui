Configuration
=============
MATLAB
------
Certain features of the application require MATLAB to be installed on your system. 
If you have MATLAB installed in a non-standard location, you will need to manually adjust the location of your MATLAB installation to the default location:

    - Windows: ``C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2024a``
    - MacOS: ``/Applications/MATLAB_R2024a.app``

.. note::
  Luckily, the application will automatically detect the MATLAB installation on your system if it is installed in the default location.

.. tip::
  If you cannot install MATLAB on your system, when using the application, make sure the ``Use C++`` option is checked before running an analysis.

Font
----
Using the installer will automatically install the required font.
However, if you are installing the application manually or if the font installation failed, you will need to install the font yourself.
You can download the font `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/booka66/mea-gui/main/resources/fonts/HackNerdFontMono-Regular.ttf>`__.
Open the downloaded font file and click the "Install" button.

.. note::
  The font is highly recommended for the application to display icons correclty as it is a JetBrains Nerd Font.
