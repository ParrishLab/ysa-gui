Configuration
=============

MATLAB
------
Certain features of the application require MATLAB to be installed on your system. 
If you have MATLAB installed in a non-standard location, you will need to manually adjust the location of your MATLAB installation to the default location:

    - Windows: ``C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2024a``
    - MacOS: ``/Applications/MATLAB_R2024a.app``

.. note::
  Luckily, the application will automatically detect the MATLAB installation on your system if it is installed in the default location.

.. tip::
  If you cannot install MATLAB on your system, when using the application, make sure the ``Use C++`` option is checked before running an analysis.
