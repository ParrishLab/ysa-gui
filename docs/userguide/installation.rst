Installation
============

There are two ways to install the application:

1. **Downloading an installer** for your operating system and following the instructions (recommended):

  - `Download <https://github.com/booka66/mea-gui/releases/latest/download/MEA_GUI_Windows.exe>`__ for Windows
  - `Download <https://github.com/booka66/mea-gui/releases/latest/download/MEA_GUI_MacOS_arm64.pkg>`__ for MacOS (Apple Silicon)
  - `Download <https://github.com/booka66/mea-gui/releases/latest/download/MEA_GUI_MacOS_x86_64.pkg>`__ for MacOS (Intel)

.. note::
  The installers are not signed, so you may need to allow the installation in the system settings. On Windows, it may be flagged as a potential threat, but choose to keep it anyway.


2. Manually from the **source code**:

  - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
    
    .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/booka66/mea-gui.git
      cd mea-gui

  - Create a virtual environment:
    
    .. code-block:: bash

      python -m venv mea_env

  - Activate the virtual environment:
  
    - Windows:

    .. code-block:: bash

      mea_env/Scripts/activate

    - MacOS:

    .. code-block:: bash

      source mea_env/bin/activate

  - Install the dependencies:
    
    .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r src/helpers/update/requirements.txt

  - Run the application:
    
    .. code-block:: bash

      python src/main.py

.. important::
  The instructions for building from the source code assume that you have Python 3.10.9 installed on your system. 
  If you don't have it, you can download it from the `official website <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/>`__.

.. note::
  Some algorithms have the option of using a MATLAB implementation. If you want to use them, you need to have MATLAB installed on your system, build from source, and use pip to install the ``matlab`` and ``matlabengine`` packages. Note that you'll need to download the correct version of matlabengine to work with your MATLAB installation.
